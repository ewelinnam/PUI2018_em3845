## Assignment 1
I decided to take a look at the CitiBike data and the median age of NYC population. I plotted a map of NYC split by puma regions and showing the distribution of median age per puma. Then I plotted the locations of citibike stations. My hypothesis was that there would be more stations in pumas where median is lower.

Review:

That is a nice plot. It shows the differences between age range based on different borough clearly. Maybe if you use the same color scheme, it is better to view by the different color shades without comparing with label.

And I noticed that your original idea in Assignment1 is adding the citibike stations' locations to the plot. Did tou try to improve the relationship between the average age and the location of citibike? If yes, I wonder that is that the times of city bike's using based on the different adverage age's regions could improve the ralationship better. Because you know, the density of citibike's location could not tell us how often the people use.

Anyway, it is a clear and logical plot.
